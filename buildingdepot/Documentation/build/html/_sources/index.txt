Overview
########

This is the official documentation of BuildingDepot v3.2.7. BuildingDepot is essentialy an Extensible and Distributed Architecture for Sensor Data Storage, Access and Sharing.


Building Depot has two essential components a Central Service and a Data
Service :

Central Service - A central directory containing details of all the buildings,users

Data Service - The core component of BD and is responsible for handling the actual sensor data. Exposes a RESTful API for retrieving data and inserting data into the system.

An institution has a single CentralService that houses data of all buildings and user accounts on campus, and multiple DataServices, each of which may contain sensor data of several buildings.

A DataService may belong to any single administrative group that requires sole control over who can access the underlying sensor data points. Different buildings on a campus might desire their own DataService.
