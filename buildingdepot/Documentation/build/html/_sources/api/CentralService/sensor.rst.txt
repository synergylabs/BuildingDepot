Sensor
######

The Sensor collection manages Sensors for Locations associated with the CentralService.Sensors can be defined in the CentralService at http://www.example.com:81/api/sensor.
Sensor access is restricted to Central Service `Users` with permissions for the Sensor and to the `Admin` who owns the Sensor.

SensorGroups and UserGroups
***************************

BuildingDepot restricts access to sensors to users on three levels. A user can have either of these types of access to a sensor:
   * **Read**
   * **Read/Write**
   * **Deny Read**
   * **Read/Write/Permission**

As the names suggest a user with read access to a sensor will be able to read all the datapoints of the sensors. A user with Read/Write access will be able to both read and write (if supported by the sensor) to the sensors. With Deny Read a user will not be able to read any datapoints of the sensor.

The basis of deciding these permissions is dependent on the abstraction of SensorGroups and UserGroups within BuildingDepot.

SensorGroups are created on the basis of tags that are specified at the time of creation. All sensors with the specified tags will be a part of the SensorGroup that is created. Usergroups are basically a list of users which are connected to a SensorGroup via a "Permissions" link. This link is what defines the level of access that the users in the UserGroup have to the sensors in the SensorGroup.
