### What is BuildingDepot? 
BuildingDepot is an Extensible and Distributed Architecture for Sensor Data Storage, Access, and Sharing. It is a data storage, management, and actuation system for building-related data. Future smart buildings will generate enormous amounts of data from SCADA systems and deployed wireless sensor networks. Managing this data is a challenge, and using it to drive energy efficiency is even more difficult.

### Why use BuildingDepot?
Buildings form an essential part of our lives and provide many services that make our indoor environment comfortable, productive, and enjoyable. With advances in communication and computing, buildings are increasingly embedded with sensors and networked devices that enable a wide variety of services, contextual services to occupants, monitoring of building infrastructure, and energy-efficient operation. 

We have created BuildingDepot as a successful IoT ecology. This includes a core building management middleware, an easy-to-use protocol agnostic API, and robust security and privacy protections to engage users with varying levels of experience.Our vision is to provide building users with a holistic view of the building across various subsystems, such as lighting, water, and air conditioning, and enable applications that work seamlessly across the underlying infrastructure.

### Features of BuildingDepot:
* ­ Integration of data from a wide variety of building systems and communication protocols 
* ­ Provide an easy-to-use API that is protocol-agnostic 
* ­ Provide a search interface to query building data and metadata 
* ­ Provide an access control system that facilitates security and privacy 
* ­ Provide support for actuation of building control systems 
* ­ Provide a platform that scales with big data across multiple buildings 
* ­ Support for standardization to enable portable building applications
